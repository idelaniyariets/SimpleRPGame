# SimpleRPGame
## Description
This is an unnamed RPG game developed in Godot Engine for my individual project. The gameplay is not particularly attractive: you have to go through locations and destroy all the monsters until you get to the final boss. [You can read more in Chapter 2 of the file at the link](https://disk.yandex.ru/i/ajo15V2Yng3uyA) (Russian)
>the game was supposed to carry a psychological message, but the inept game designer failed in his task :) (dev)

## Speedrun???
This game has a lot of holes and I can't find them all. These holes provide you with a lot of speedrunning opportunities (some of them are deliberately hidden in the code). So if your speedrun is less than ten minutes or contains interesting skips and bugs you can send it to me and we'll discuss it (I hope it will be interesting)
